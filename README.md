This a simple app to manage your cacti. At the moment, you can add new cacti, view info about existing ones, and remove them.

The app uses Android Jetpack Compose, which is a modern way to build Android apps.

The code is organized in a clean way, using best practices for Compose development. This is just the beginning, and I'll add more features and improvements in future commits.
